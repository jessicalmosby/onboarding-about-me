            <p>How Buster Came Into My Life</p>
            <p>
                I actually got Buster from one of my best friends! He was her husband's dog. They
                had three animals in total and just had their first baby! With three animals and a
                new baby, it was a lot to handle. They knew I was completely in love with Buster and
                vice versa so they asked if I was willing to adopt him. I, of course, said yes with
                no hesitation!<br />
                That is how Buster became the light of my life.
